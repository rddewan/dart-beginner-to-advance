# Module 9: Advanced Dart Features

## 9.1 Generics

**Explanation:**  
Generics allow you to write type-safe, reusable code by parameterizing classes, functions, and methods with types. They enforce the correct type at compile time and promote code reusability.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.1 Generics

generics.dart

```

## 9.2 Type Definitions (Type Aliases)

**Explanation:**  
Type definitions (type aliases) give a new name to an existing type for clarity and brevity. They apply to both function types and complex generic types.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.2 Type Definitions (Type Aliases)

type_definitions.dart

```

## 9.3 Extensions

**Explanation:**  
Extensions add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code. They let you add methods, getters, and setters to any type.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.3 Extensions

extensions.dart

```

## 9.4 Enums (Enumerations)

**Explanation:**  
Enums define a set of named constant values. Enhanced enums (since Dart 2.17) can include members, methods, and even implement interfaces, making them more versatile.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.4 Enums (Enumerations)

enums.dart

```

## 9.5 Callable Classes

**Explanation:**  
Callable classes implement a `call()` method, allowing their instances to be invoked as if they were functions. This is useful for objects that primarily represent an operation or calculation.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.5 Callable Classes

callable_classes.dart

```

## 9.6 Records (Dart 3.0+)

**Explanation:**  
Records provide a lightweight way to group multiple values without creating formal classes. Records can be positional, named, or mixed and are immutable.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.6 Records (Dart 3.0+)

records.dart

```

## 9.7 Patterns (Dart 3.0+)

**Explanation:**  
Patterns enable matching and destructuring of data within control flows such as switch expressions, if-case statements, and variable declarations. They simplify handling structured data.

**Code Sample:**
```dart

// 9.7 Patterns (Dart 3.0+)

patterns.dart

```
